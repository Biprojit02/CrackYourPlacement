# Crack Your Internship / Crack Your Placement Challenge
Welcome to my journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through Arsh's 45-day challenge! This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress, sharing solutions, and documenting learnings as I work through 4-5 DSA questions daily.

## Challenge Overview
Arsh's DSA challenge is designed to help improve problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews. The goal is to complete the DSA sheet in 45-60 days by solving 4-5 questions every day.

## How to Participate
1. Fork this Repository: Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Solve Daily Questions: Aim to solve 4-5 questions from the DSA sheet every day.
3. Commit Your Solutions: Update your repository daily with your solutions.
4. Build in Public: Announce your participation on LinkedIn, Twitter, or Instagram using the hashtags #CrackYourInternship and #CrackYourPlacement to stay accountable.
